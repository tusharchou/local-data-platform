    Test the `query` method of the `GCPBigQueryConnection` class.

    This test verifies that the `query` method correctly executes a SQL query and returns the expected results.
    It mocks the service account credentials and BigQuery client to simulate the interaction with Google Cloud Platform.

    Args:
        mock_service_account_credentials (MagicMock): Mocked service account credentials.
        mock_bigquery_client (MagicMock): Mocked BigQuery client.
        temp_credentials_file (str): Path to a temporary credentials file.

    Steps:
    1. Mock the service account credentials and BigQuery client.
    2. Initialize the `GCPBigQueryConnection` with the temporary credentials file and project ID.
    3. Execute the `query` method with a sample SQL query.
    4. Verify that the results match the expected output.
    5. Ensure that the `query` method was called with the correct query string.
