def cron_flow(cron_expression: str, etl_function: callable, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
    """
    Schedule an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to run at specific intervals using a cron job.

    Args:
        cron_expression (str): The cron expression that specifies the schedule for the ETL job. It follows the standard 
            cron format: "minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week".
            Example: "0 2 * * *" for running the ETL job daily at 2 AM.
        etl_function (callable): The function that executes the ETL process, which can be passed as a reference.
            This function should handle the extract, transform, and load stages of the process.
        *args: Additional positional arguments to pass to the ETL function.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the ETL function.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the cron expression is invalid or if the ETL function is not callable.
        Exception: If an error occurs during the scheduling or execution of the ETL job.

    Example:
        cron_flow("0 0 * * 0", run_etl_process, source="data_source", target="data_target")
        
    Notes:
        - This function requires the cron job to be set up and managed using a task scheduler (e.g., cron in Unix-like 
          systems or any equivalent scheduling tool).
        - Ensure that the ETL function handles any errors internally, as the scheduling system may not handle exceptions

def run_etl_process(source: str, target: str, transform_function: callable = None, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
    """
    Execute the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

    This function orchestrates the three stages of an ETL process:
    1. Extract data from a source.
    2. Optionally transform the data using a transformation function.
    3. Load the transformed (or raw) data into the target destination.

    Args:
        source (str): The data source from which to extract the data. It can be a file path, database connection string,
            or API endpoint.
        target (str): The destination where the data will be loaded. It can be a database, file path, or another storage
            mechanism.
        transform_function (callable, optional): A function that performs the transformation of the extracted data. 
            This function should accept the extracted data as input and return the transformed data. If no transformation 
            is needed, this argument can be left as `None` (default is `None`).
        *args: Additional positional arguments to pass to the transformation function or loading process.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the transformation function or loading process.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the source or target is invalid or if the transformation function does not return the expected output.
        IOError: If an error occurs during data extraction or loading.
        Exception: For any other issues that occur during the ETL process.

    Example:
        run_etl_process(source="database_connection_string", 
                        target="data_warehouse",
                        transform_function=transform_data,
                        batch_size=1000)
        
    Notes:
        - The `transform_function` is optional. If provided, it should handle the logic for transforming the extracted data.
        - This function assumes that the source and target formats are compatible with the extraction and loading logic
          implemented in the ETL process.
        - The actual implementation of extraction, transformation, and loading will depend on the specific needs of the
          application (e.g., connecting to databases, reading/writing files, etc.).
