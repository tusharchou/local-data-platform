New York Taxi and Limousine Commission
TLC Trip Record Data

Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times,
pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types,
and driver-reported passenger counts.

For-Hire Vehicle (“FHV”) trip records include fields capturing the dispatching base license number and the pick-up date,
time, and taxi zone location ID (shape file below).

All files will be stored in the PARQUET format.
Trip data will be published monthly (with two months delay) instead of bi-annually.
HVFHV files will now include 17 more columns (please see High Volume FHV Trips Dictionary for details).
Additional columns will be added to the old files as well.
