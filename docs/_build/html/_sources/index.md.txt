title: Local Data Platform

# Welcome to local-data-platform's documentation!

**local-data-platform** is a Python library to build, test, and run a complete data platform on your local machine. The core idea is to provide a "toy box for data"â€”a local environment where you can manage the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to reporting, before needing to scale up to a cloud environment.

This documentation will help you get started with the library.
