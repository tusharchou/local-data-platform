# Agentic Marketing Analyser

## Summary

This feature proposes the integration of an AI-powered agent that delivers location-specific marketing insights to help tour and activity operators understand what’s working and what needs attention across their local digital channels. Powered by a Local Data Platform (LDP), the agent transforms raw marketing data into clear, actionable recommendations that drive bookings, visibility, and revenue.

## Problem It Solves

Most small to mid-sized tourism operators struggle with marketing decisions. Common pain points include:

- "Which campaigns are working in which locations?"
- "What should I post next to drive more bookings?"
- "Why are bookings slow this week despite good reviews?"
- "Where should I focus marketing budget or effort?"

They lack in-house marketing teams. What they need is a smart, always-on guide that understands local trends and acts like a data-driven marketing assistant.

## Feature Summary

The AI agent will:
- Aggregate social media, OTA, review, and campaign data.
- Analyze performance by product, region, season, and timing.
- Generate insights in natural GPT-style language.
- Recommend next best actions to improve visibility, conversions, and bookings.
