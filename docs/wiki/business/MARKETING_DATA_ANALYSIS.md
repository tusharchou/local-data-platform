# AI Agent for Marketing Data Analysis

## Summary

This feature proposes the integration of an AI-powered agent that delivers location-specific marketing insights to help tour and activity operators understand what's working — and what needs attention — across their local digital channels. Powered by a Local Data Platform (LDP), the agent transforms raw marketing data into clear, actionable recommendations.

## Problem It Solves

Most small to mid-sized operators struggle to answer key questions:

- "Which campaigns are working in which locations?"
- "What should I post next to drive more bookings?"
- "Why are bookings slow this week despite good reviews?"
- "Where should I spend my marketing effort or ad budget?"

They don’t have marketing teams — they need a smart guide that understands local nuances and acts like a digital marketing brain.

## Feature Summary

The AI agent will:
- Aggregate social media, OTA, review, and campaign data.
- Analyze performance by product, region, and timing.
- Generate digestible insights with GPT-like natural language.
- Recommend practical actions to improve visibility and bookings.
