# Project Overview

**local-data-platform** is a Python library to build, test, and run a complete data platform on your local machine. The core idea is to provide a "toy box for data"â€”a local environment where you can manage the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to reporting, before needing to scale up to a cloud environment.

This approach allows developers and businesses to save on cloud infrastructure costs during the initial development and testing phases, with a clear path for future scaling.

> **Vision:** Local Data Platform is used as a python library to learn 
> and operate data lake house locally.  
> **Mission:** Develop a python package which provides solutions for all stages
> of data organisation, ranging from ingestion to reporting. The goal is that one can build data pipelines locally, test them, and easily scale up to the cloud.
