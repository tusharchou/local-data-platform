# Hello, Local Data Platform!

Welcome to the documentation for **local-data-platform**, a Python library to build, test, and run a complete data platform on your local machine.

The core idea is to provide a "toy box for data"â€”a local environment where you can manage the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to reporting, before needing to scale up to a cloud environment.

## Getting Started

-   **[User Guide & Recipes](./recipes.md)**: Practical examples and step-by-step guides to help you use the library.
-   **[API Reference](./api.md)**: Detailed information on the classes, functions, and modules.

We hope you find this documentation helpful!
