# Update on Developer Experience Improvements

**To:** Product Designer, Product Manager

**From:** The Development Team

**Subject:** Upcoming PR: `feat(dx): Add Makefile and setup guide #96`

---

Hello Team,

This is a quick update on an upcoming Pull Request that significantly improves our development workflow. This PR introduces a `Makefile` and a comprehensive `how_to_setup.md` guide.

### For the Product Designer

This change will make it much faster and more consistent for you to set up a local development environment. If you ever need to run the project locally to test a new design or component, the process will be simplified to just a couple of straightforward commands, reducing friction and getting you up and running in minutes.

### For the Product Manager

This initiative is focused on improving our overall Developer Experience (DX). A better DX directly translates to faster onboarding for new team members and more efficient development cycles for the entire team. By standardizing our setup and common commands, we reduce time spent on environment-related issues and can focus more on delivering features, ultimately leading to quicker and more predictable progress.

### Next Steps

No action is required from you on this PR. We wanted to keep you informed about this foundational improvement that will help streamline our development process for everyone involved.
